# cute42
Cute42 is for astrodynamics simulation.

"Cute42" is developed and maintained by Yu Tso (左昀). It is built with GUI based on Qt (pronounced “cute”) framework by me and and computing part based on "42" by  Dr. Eric Stoneking (his github:https://github.com/ericstoneking).
The goal is to program "Cute42" as a powerful astrodynamics simulation package equipped with user-friendly GUI, clear data visualization tools (both coded by me with Qt framework) and the computing part from "42" as a library.
Thanks to Dr. Eric Stoneking sharing his source code and sharing it with the public, I can make something different.

The Demo: (The GUI part is coded by me and the window with a satallite rendered is from "42")
